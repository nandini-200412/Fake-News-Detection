# 📰 Fake News Detection

A machine learning project designed to detect fake news using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. This application helps in classifying news articles as real or fake, using logistic regression and Naive Bayes algorithms.

## 🚀 Project Overview

With the rise of misinformation, identifying fake news has become a crucial task. This project leverages **Python**, **Scikit-learn**, and **NLP** to classify news content efficiently. The model is deployed using **Streamlit** to provide a simple and interactive user interface.

## 🧠 Features

- Classifies news as **Real** or **Fake**
- Utilizes **TF-IDF Vectorization** for feature extraction
- Implements **Logistic Regression** and **Naive Bayes**
- Deployed using **Streamlit** for user interaction
- Includes **joblib** for model serialization
